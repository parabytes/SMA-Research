Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets to find misinformation spread by the inorganic accounts.

# \#Misinformation: COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter

6,430 unverified inorganic accounts were found in a dataset of 260,087 COVID-19 related tweets ranging from January 21, 2020 to November 23, 2020. Accounts were classified as inorganic if the probability was greater than 0.5 based on the probabilities obtained from tweetbotornot2.

Research shows that the vast majority of inorganic accounts related to COVID-19 were created in 2020. Inorganic accounts more often share links, however organic accounts more often retweet. In the dataset, organic accounts retweeted 72,458 accounts, and out of these 6,374 accounts were classified as inorganic accounts. The links shared by the inorganic accounts are usually from untrusted sources.

The sentiment of tweets for the inorganic accounts is mostly neutral to positive, however organic accounts tend to have more negative to neutral tweets. Topic modeling shows that the inorganic accounts have some overlap and closeness implying the discussion is focused on similar topics. Organic accounts have more variation in their topics of discussion.

This work demonstrates that there is evidence of misinformation being spread by the inorganic accounts, and the links that are posted by the inorganic accounts are mostly self-referential sources, which are presented as facts, but lack verification by other trusted sources.

More research is needed to understand the role of inorganic accounts in spreading misinformation in regards to COVID-19 and its societal ramifications. Moving forward, an important research question to consider should include the relationship between COVID-19 misinformation being spread by inorganic accounts and their link to positive cases.

There are more files assosciated with the research. These files are simply too large to commit. The entire research generated 4.9GB of data. In order to save space only select files were committed. If you need all the files for verification so it can be incorporated in your own research, please contact me at pahuja@jh.edu and I will be happy to make the entire research available to you via Google drive. Alternatively, you may look at another repo that I forked from the researchers at University of South California. This repo is titled COVID-19-TweetIDs.
